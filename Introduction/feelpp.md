#The Feel++ Project
Feel++ is abbreviation for `Finite Element Embedded Language and Library in C++`.
Developed by Cemosis, Feel++ is a unified C++ implementation of Galerkin methods (finite and spectral element methods) in 1D, 2D And 3D to solve partial differential equations.

Feel++ open source project is
- a versatile mathematical kernel solving easily problems using different techniques thus allowing testing and comparing methods, e.g. cG versus dG,
- a small and manageable library which nevertheless encompasses a wide range of numerical methods and techniques and in particular reduced order methods such as the reduced basis method
- a software that follows closely the mathematical abstractions associated with partial differential equations (PDE) and in particular the finite element mathematical framework and variational formulations
- a library that offers solving strategies that scales up to thousands and even tens of thousands of cores (it is supported by a european Prace project currently )
- a library entirely in ''C++'' allowing to create ''C++'' complex and typically non-linear multi-physics applications currently in industry, physics and health-care.

Currently the Feel++ project contains two websites: www.feelpp.org and doc.feelpp.org. The first website is a  static website generated by Jekyll serves as main website provides information about the open source project itself. And the second website is generated by `Doxygen`, serves as a collection of project's docmentations.

What needs to be done during my internship is to migrate these two websites from Github to a specific server owned by the University of Strasbourg, and to isolate all the project related news wrote in `markdown` into a centralized news repository hosted on Github.
