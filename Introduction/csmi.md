#Master Calcul Scientifique Et Mathématiques De L'Information
The CSMI(Master Calcul Scientifique et Mathématiques de l'Information) is two years training that terminates with a master degree in applied mathematics at the University of Starsbourg.
The Master CSMI is for holders of a license in mathematics who wish to move towards a career in engineering or towards a PhD in applied mathematics. The objective of this training is to give a dual competence in scientific computing and mathematics information.
As a newly created training program, it needs a website to presents and to attract potential candidates. Like the two websites mentioned before, I need to build it with Jekyll and host it on the dedicated server.

The website (csmi.math.unistra.fr and its alias csmi.cemosis.fr) should cover all information about the master CSMI. It should also include contacts of previous years graduates, the relationship with enterprises and testimonials of previous students. Finally, the whole website must be translated into English and German, in order to welcome international students.
