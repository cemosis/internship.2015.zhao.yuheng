#Conclusion

In a nutshell, this internship has been an excellent and rewarding experience. I can conclude that there have been a lot I’ve learnt from my work at Cemosis.
Needless to say, the technical aspects of the work I’ve done are not flawless and could be improved provided enough time.
As someone with no prior experience with Node.js whatsoever I believe my time spent in research and discovering it was well worth it and contributed to finding an acceptable solution to build a fully fonctional web service. Two main things that I’ve learned the importance of are time-management skills and self-motivation.
