Chapter 3 contains my works in the week 30 of 2015. I installed a nodejs server with deployment scripts on an internal server. With the help of Mr. Huber, I tried to expand the feature of these scripts to generate documentation files for Feel++ project.

There are also some refactoring and tweaks to the CSMI website.
