# Make it reponsive

The Boostrap 3 natively support reponsive design. By using its grid system, we can even explicitly match our layout to different devices. 

The grid system has four tiers of classes: xs(phones), sm(tablets), md(desktops), and lg(larger desktops). In hmtl code, we can in fact use them at the time, so that the layout would changes as the screen width of the device changes.

```html
<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8"></div>
	...
<div class="col-xs-8 col-md-4"></div>
	...
```
To defines different style rules for a specify element in web page, i used media queries.

```html
@media screen and (max-width: 990px){
  .slide1, .slide2, .slide3, .slide4, .slide5 {
    height: 110vh;
  }
}

@media screen and (max-width: 768px){
  .slide1, .slide2, .slide3, .slide4, .slide5 {
    height: 110vh;
  }
}

@media screen and (max-width: 400px){
  .slide1, .slide2, .slide3, .slide4, .slide5 {
    height: 155vh;
  }
} 

```
This code snippet means that the height of slides grows as the screen width of device becomes smaller. The CSS `vh` unit means its relative to viewport'height or width.
