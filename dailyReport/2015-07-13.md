#A localization solution: jekyll-multiple-plugin

## Install and set-up
To install multiple languages plugin:

```bash
gem install jekyll-multiple-language-plugin
```

In the file `_plugins/ext.rb` add: 

```ruby
require 'jekyll/multiple/language/plugin
```

Set configuration in _config.yml: 

```yaml
languages: ["fr", "en", "de"]

exclud_from_localizations: ["js", "images", "stylesheet"]
```
This means the default language is French, the pages will aslo translated into English and German. When the gem helps jekyll generate html pages, it will not recopy files in js folder, images folder or stylesheet. If i don't set excluded files, it will copy all assets file into the translated site folder like `_fr` and `_de`. Which will take more store space.

Next we need to create a folder called `_18n`(named by the gem's author) and create 3 translation asset files: `de.yml`, `en.yml`, and `fr.yml` in it.  

These files contain text blocks and their associated variable names which can be access via Liquid template language.

`fr.yml`
```yaml
global:

navbar:
    home: Page d'accueil
    team: "&Eacute;quipe"
    promotions: Promotions
    news: Actualit&eacute;s
    course: Enseignements
```
`en.yml`
```yaml
global:

navbar:
    home: Home
    team: Team
    promotions: Classes
    news: News
    course: Courses
```

So with these two files, i can simply use `{{ t navbar.home }}` in my index.html file for representing the navigation button which targets to home page.

After test, this approach works perfectly for index page. And for URLs like `http://csmi.cemosis.fr/team/`, we need to create a `team` folder and do the same thing, which means we recreate de.yml, en.yml and fr.yml in that folder.
