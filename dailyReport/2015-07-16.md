# Localization plugin bug fix

When i created the news webpage, jekyll can't read the build-in data type `post`. So i created a default basic website and test why it doesn't work. Once i add the localization plugin to the website, the post all disappeared. Then i went to the developer's github page and found out that there was bug report. 

I broswer the source code, and found this following code snippet.

```ruby
alias :read_posts_org :read_posts
def read_posts(dir)
  if dir == ''
    read_posts("_i18n/#{self.config['lang']}/")
  else
    read_posts_org(dir)
  end
end
```
The read_posts method is a jekyll's built-in function that reads all the files in `<base>/_posts` and create a new Post object with each one. By default it will use `_posts` as parameter, but somehow it doesn't work correctly here.
So what i did for now is that i passed `_posts` as parameter so that it can read correctly the post. Need to figure out what exactly this code snippet means to fix what the developer's intended to do. (Maybe he wants to put post in different language in the `_18n` folder)

```ruby
alias :read_posts_org :read_posts
def read_posts(dir)
  if dir == '_posts'
    read_posts("_i18n/#{self.config['lang']}/")
  else
    read_posts_org(dir)
  end
end
```
