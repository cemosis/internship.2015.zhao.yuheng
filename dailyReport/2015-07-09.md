#CSMI website development
Website changes:

Added courses tables with Bootstrap styles [table class](https://github.com/solael/csmi.cemosis.fr/blob/master/index.html#L263)

Added empty anchor element to fix the problem when jump to a section, some part is covered by the top-fixed navbar [code](https://github.com/solael/csmi.cemosis.fr/blob/master/index.html#L225)

Using jsSocial to generate share to social network buttons. It depends on jquery, so include jquery before using it. And it can use font-awesome framwork's icons.

```html
<script>
  $("#share").jsSocials({
      shares: ["email", "twitter", "facebook", "googleplus", "linkedin"],
      url: "https://cemosis.github.io/csmi.cemosis.fr/",
      text: "Master mention Mathématiques et Applications, Spécialité Calcul Scientifique et Mathématiques de l'Information",
      showLabel: true,
      showCount: true
  });
</script>
```

This is the global configuration of it when the click event is triggered.

Added the icons' author's link in the footer:

 <p>Icons made by <a href="http://www.freepik.com/">Freepik</a> from <a href="www.flaticon.com">flaticon</a></p>

We discussed about making a web service on a virtual machine inside of university in order to auto deploy CSMI website in local server.(Because if we just deploy it on an external server, university will not be happy with it.)

So the process will be the flowing things:

1. Set up a back-end server on the machine, get the webhook's paylod from HTTP header(JSON format)

2. Parse the information in the payload and decide to deploy the website. Starting by clone the master branch and deploy it on local server.
3. Keep this web service running, so whenever a commit or merge came in, it will deploy the website.

[good exemple using Sinatra to achieve the goal](https://developer.github.com/guides/delivering-deployments/)
