# Install jekyll-hook on internal server

I installed jekyll-hook and its dependencies on an internal virtual machine. All the procedures are the [same](ch2/webhook.md), but the webhooks from Github are blocked by firewall. The network administrator told me that I can specify some IP addresses so that he can put them on firewall's white list. I will test webhooks again after he establishes new firewall rules.

I also start reading the travis ci documentation for deployment on Github.
