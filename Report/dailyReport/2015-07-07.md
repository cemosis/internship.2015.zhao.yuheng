#Stage cemosis
At the beginning of the day, I continued adding css styles to the website. I added the high-lighted current page effect to the navigation button, a drop-down menu for the navigation menu, a table of contents and a logo link with cemosis logo.
But to develop a new modern website rapidly, i need to use jekyll theme or a front-end framework like twitter Bootstrap. Bootstrap is famousr responsive front-end framework. It has many handy weell-designed components.

In the afternoon we had a meeting about the objectives of this website. What content should be included and how to reprensent them.
Before and after this meeting, i started recreating the website with Boostrap. I added a navigation bar with the component called navbar and chosed the top-fix attribute to make the bar floats on the top of the website when user are browsing the website.

Below the navigaition bar i created a marketing panel with jumbotron component. The marketing panel is widly used nowadays.
Then there is an image panel with shadow effect. After these parts i created a course section, a video section and testimony section with container component.
