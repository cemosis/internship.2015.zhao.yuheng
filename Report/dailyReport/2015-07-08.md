#Responsive option, font-aweson framework and content intergration
To active responsive option we just need to add [this](https://github.com/solael/csmi.cemosis.fr/blob/master/index.html#L10) in the head tag.
For displaying the social network link like facebook, i included font-awesome framework in the html file. It will help me create a footer link with an icon before the link.
I strated intergrate some contents in the main page. I still need to understand how to render a markdown file or asciidoc file into html page with jekyll and how to build layout.

After searching a bit, i think that using asciidoc may not be a good idea. It seems when jekyll generates html with asciidoc file, the Boostrap framework won't work any more. I will try it out, maybe the markdown file would bring less trouble.
If asciidoc doesn't work with Bootstrap, then maybe i must try something like [this](http://laurent-laville.org/asciidoc/bootstrap/).

For now the website has problems like: 
the panels have different height, one link in the partnership panel overlap the Share panel, need some seperated html files to make a layout, need to put all contents into markup language but not directly into html.
