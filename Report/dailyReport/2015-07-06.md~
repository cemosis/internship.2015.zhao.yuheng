#stage cemosis

After finalizing the most part of administration works, i set up the csmi github repository and start working on the index page.
With the help of M. Ancel, i start working with the github workflow.

Regarding the index page, i added the basic content from the original Cemosis website which include the general description of the csmi master and a table for all the courses. For now it has just font style matches to the Cemosis main website.
