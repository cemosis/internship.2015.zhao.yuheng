# Preface
In order to complete my first year study at ENSIIE, I chose to do my internship at Strasbourg. This internship is centered with development on Github which is beneficial as the open source community grows fast within these years. There is also an important part of website front-end development involved during my internship, which is also highly demanded in the job market.

For this opportunity, I thank:

**Pr. Christophe Prud'homme**, who is the director of Cemosis and my internship supervisor. I want to thank him for giving me the opportunity to follow my internship at Cemosis. He had the kindness to accept me and guide me through my internship with advice, feedback and tips despite his busy schedule.

**Dr. Vincent Huber**, who is a research engineer at Cemosis. He helped me construct the scripts for generating feelpp's documentations.

**Dr. Alexandre Ancel**, who is also a research engineer at Cemosis. He guided me to use Github workflow.
